title: "Plan Persistence"
---

The output of \`terraform plan\` can be stored either in GitHub Artifacts, or in a GCP bucket. When you run apply, Digger will pick up the stored plan.

Use the following workflow option to use Artifacts plan storage:
```
upload-plan-destination: github
```
Or to use a GCP bucket:
```
upload-plan-destination: gcp
```

## Plan json file naming convention

The location of plan json output file is:

```
$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/$GITHUB_ORG-$REPO#DIGGER_PROJECT.tfplan
```

Note that `$GIHTUB_WORKSPACE` may contain repo name twice; it also may contain the project directory e.g "dev" because the workdir is relative to project. Repo name is then appended for the 3rd time between org name and project name. So the final file path for a repo named "myrepo" with a project named "development" at `/dev` may look like this:

```
/home/runner/work/myrepo/myrepo/dev/diggerhq-myrepo#development.tfplan
```
