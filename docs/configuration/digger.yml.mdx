Default workflow will be created for you if you don't specify any workflows in the configuration. It will have the following configuration:

on\_pull\_request\_pushed: \[digger plan\]

on\_pull\_request\_closed: \[digger unlock\]

on\_commit\_to\_default: \[digger unlock\]

Workflow configuration explanation

[](#workflow-configuration-explanation)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workflow configuration describes how to react to CI events. It has 3 sections:

*   on\_pull\_request\_pushed - describes what to do when pull request is created or updated
    

*   on\_pull\_request\_closed - describes what to do when pull request is closed
    

*   on\_commit\_to\_default - describes what to do when pull request is merged into default branch
    

A project in Digger corresponds to a directory containing Terraform code. Projects are treated as standalone independent entities with their own locks. Digger will not prevent you from running plan and apply in different projects simultaneously.

You can run plan / apply in a specified project by using the -p option in Github PR comment:

digger apply -p my-second-app

Include / exclude patterns

This docs page needs improvement. Please consider contributing to

. Here is the

[relevant PR](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/pull/301)

implementing this feature

You can specify wildcard and glob patterns in digger.yml to include multiple directories into a project. A common use case for this is if you have multiple environment folders and they import from a common `modules` directory:

If you wanted to trigger plans for all `modules/` folder in both dev and prod projects you would include them in the `include_patterns` key. Similarly you put anything which you want to ignore in the `exclude_patterns` key ( exclude takes precedence over includes).

include\_patterns: \["./modules/\*\*"\]

workflow: default\_workflow

include\_patterns: \["./modules/\*\*"\]

exclude\_patterns: \["./modules/dev\_only\_module/\*\*"\]
